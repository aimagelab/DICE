Official implementation of "What Changed? Detecting and Evaluating Instruction-Guided Image Edits with Multimodal Large Language Models"

## Overview

DICE (DIfference Coherence Estimator) is a novel framework designed to detect and evaluate instruction-guided image edits. It identifies differences between original and edited images and assesses their coherence with the editing prompt using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

The framework consists of two main components:
1. **Difference Detector**: Identifies localized differences between the original and edited images
2. **Coherence Estimator**: Assesses the relevance of detected changes with respect to the editing prompt

## Key Features

- Object-level difference detection between image pairs
- Semantic coherence evaluation of edits
- Structured text generation for edit analysis
- High correlation with human judgment
